# Card-Game
CSCI41 Group project, Spring 2018

Untitled card game:

This project is a turn based card game. User will be able to make a deck.

Each card will have a damage, health, and cost #.

Each player will have Health # and energy #(each card has a cost, can only spend as much energy as they got, resets every turn).

User enters 3 phases:
  -phase 1 user draws a card
  -phase 2 user can place down cards( depending how much the card cost)
  -phase 3 user can choose to attack the player directly, or attack a card.

END TURN.

Player who loses all health loses.
